Experiment 4.3: Ticket Booking System

This program simulates a ticket booking system where multiple users (threads) try to book seats at the same time. The key challenges addressed are:

1) Avoiding Double Booking ‚Üí Using synchronized methods to ensure no two users book the same seat.
2) Prioritizing VIP Customers ‚Üí Using thread priorities so VIP users' bookings are processed before regular users.

üìå Core Concepts Used
Ô∏è1 Synchronized Booking Method
The method bookSeat() is marked as synchronized, ensuring that only one thread can access it at a time.
This prevents race conditions, where two threads might try to book the same seat simultaneously.
  
Ô∏è2 Thread Priorities for VIP Customers
Threads representing VIP users are assigned Thread.MAX_PRIORITY so they execute first.
Regular users have Thread.NORM_PRIORITY or Thread.MIN_PRIORITY, making them process later.

3 Handling Multiple Users
Each user trying to book a seat is represented by a thread.
Users can select a seat, and if it‚Äôs already booked, they receive an error message.


Step-by-Step Execution
1 Initialize the TicketBookingSystem ‚Üí Allows booking of N seats.
2 Create Multiple Booking Threads ‚Üí Each user (VIP or Regular) is assigned a thread.
3 Start All Threads ‚Üí Threads compete for booking, with VIPs processed first.
4 Ensure No Double Booking ‚Üí synchronized method prevents duplicate seat allocation.
5 Threads Finish Execution & Display Booking Status.


üîπ Why Use Synchronization?
Without synchronized, two threads might book the same seat simultaneously, causing double booking issues. Using synchronized, only one thread at a time can modify the seat booking data.

üîπ Why Use Thread Priorities?
Setting higher priority for VIP users ensures their bookings are processed first, simulating real-world priority-based bookings.

Test Cases

Test Case 1: No Seats Available Initially
Input:
System starts with 5 seats.
No users attempt to book.
Expected Output:
No bookings yet.

Test Case 2: Successful Booking
Input:
Anish (VIP) books Seat 1.
Bobby (Regular) books Seat 2.
Charlie (VIP) books Seat 3.
Expected Output:
Anish (VIP) booked seat 1
Bobby (Regular) booked seat 2
Charlie (VIP) booked seat 3

Test Case 3: Thread Priorities (VIP First)
Input:
Bobby (Regular) books Seat 4 (low priority).
Anish (VIP) books Seat 4 (high priority).
Expected Output:
Anish (VIP) booked seat 4
Bobby (Regular): Seat 4 is already booked!

Test Case 4: Preventing Double Booking
Input:
Anish (VIP) books Seat 1.
Bobby (Regular) tries to book Seat 1 again.
Expected Output:
Anish (VIP) booked seat 1
Bobby (Regular): Seat 1 is already booked!

Test Case 5: Booking After All Seats Are Taken
Input:
All 5 seats are booked.
A new user (Regular) tries to book Seat 3.
Expected Output:
Error: Seat 3 is already booked!

Test Case 6: Invalid Seat Selection
Input:
User tries to book Seat 0 (out of range).
User tries to book Seat 6 (beyond available seats).
Expected Output:
Invalid seat number!

Test Case 7: Simultaneous Bookings (Concurrency Test)
Input:
10 users try booking at the same time for 5 seats.
Expected Output:
5 users successfully book seats.
5 users receive error messages for already booked seats.
